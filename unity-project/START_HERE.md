## ⚡ Super Quick Start (TL;DR)

If you're experienced with Unity:

1. **Create Unity Project**
   - 3D URP template
   - Name: "ProductionPlantDigitalTwin"

2. **Copy Scripts**
   - Copy `Assets/Scripts/` to your project

3. **Create Scene**
   - Add ProductionPlantManager GameObject
   - Add components (use primitives for speed)
   - Link components to manager

4. **Build**
   - Use `Build > Production Plant Builder`
   - Output to: `../frontend/public/unity-builds/`

5. **Test**
   - Run `npm run dev` in frontend
   - Navigate to Digital Twin section

**Done!** 🎉
