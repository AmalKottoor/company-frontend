## üìä Understanding Metrics

### OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)
**Formula:** Availability √ó Performance √ó Quality

**Target:** 85%+ is world-class

**What it means:**
- **100%** = Perfect operation
- **85%+** = Excellent
- **60-85%** = Good
- **<60%** = Needs improvement

---

### Availability
**Formula:** Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)

**What it measures:** How often equipment is running

---

### Performance
**Formula:** Actual Output / Ideal Output

**What it measures:** How fast equipment runs vs maximum speed

---

### Quality
**Formula:** Good Parts / Total Parts

**What it measures:** Percentage of defect-free products

---

### Throughput
**Formula:** Items Produced / Time (per minute)

**What it measures:** Production rate

---

### Cycle Time
**Formula:** Time / Items Produced (seconds per item)

**What it measures:** How long each item takes

---

### MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)
**What it measures:** Average operating time before failure

**Higher is better** - More reliable equipment

---

### MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)
**What it measures:** Average time to fix failures

**Lower is better** - Faster repairs

---

## üé® Visual Indicators

### Status Lights

**Control Room:**
- üü¢ **Green Light** = AUTO mode active
- üîµ **Blue Light** = MANUAL mode active

**System Buttons:**
- üü¢ **Green Border** = System running
- ‚ö´ **Gray** = System stopped

**Emergency Stop:**
- üî¥ **Red** = Always visible
- Glowing when active

---

### Equipment Status

**Active Equipment:**
- Moving parts (conveyors, fans)
- Glowing indicators
- Particle effects (steam, discharge)
- Animated components

**Inactive Equipment:**
- Stationary
- Dim lights
- No effects
- Still appearance
